# Use vim as the man page viewer
#   - Shows man pages with color coding
#	- Allows hyperlinks to other man pages
#	- Space (page down) and q (quit) work as expected
# 	- Folding is enabled by default (remove fold commands to disable)
#
# Requirements:
#	- Alias man="path to this script"
#	- Source the Vim Man plugin from: $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/man.vim
#		- This is usually at "/usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/ftplugin/man.vim but
#		may vary.
#		- Add the following to your Vim rc file
#			source /usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/ftplugin/man.vim

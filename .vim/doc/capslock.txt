SUMMARY                                         *capslock*

This plugin enables a software caps lock.  This is advantageous over a regular
caps lock in that normal mode commands, other buffers, and other applications
are unaffected.

                                                *capslock-i_CTRL-G_c*
The default insert mode mapping is <C-G>c, and there is no default normal mode
mapping.  If you make frequent use of this feature, you will probably want to
change this.  Try something like
>
        imap <C-L>     <Plug>CapsLockToggle
        nmap <Leader>l <Plug>CapsLockToggle
<
Alternatively, enable the shorter insert mode mapping on a per-filetype basis:
>
        autocmd FileType sql,cobol imap <buffer> <C-L> <Plug>CapsLockToggle
<
<Plug>CapsLockEnable and <Plug>CapsLockDisable are also provided.

One may prefer a normal mode mapping that enters insert mode and activates
caps lock:
>
        nmap <Leader>i i<Plug>CapsLockToggle
<
By default, caps lock is automatically disabled after leaving insert mode for
the insert mode mappings, but must be explicitly disabled for the normal mode
mappings.  If you always want to use the latter method, make your insert mode
mapping call the normal mode one.
>
        imap <C-L> <C-O><Plug>CapsLockToggle
<
Two functions, CapsLockStatusline() and CapsLockSTATUSLINE(), are provided for
use inside %{} in your statusline.  These respectively return "[caps]" and
",CAPS" if the software caps lock is enabled.  Here's an example usage that
won't cause problems if capslock.vim is missing:
>
        set statusline^=%{exists('*CapsLockStatusline')?CapsLockStatusline():''}

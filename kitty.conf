# Choose whether to use the system implementation of wcwidth() (used to

# You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut that is
# assigned in the default configuration.
#
# You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single shortcut, using the
# syntax below:
# map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...
# For example:
# map ctrl+shift+e combine : new_window : next_layout
# this will create a new window and switch to the next available layout

# Clipboard

map super+c        copy_to_clipboard
# You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any program using
# pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's open program is used, but
# you can specify your own, for example:
# map ctrl+shift+o      pass_selection_to_program firefox
map super+o        pass_selection_to_program

# Scrolling
